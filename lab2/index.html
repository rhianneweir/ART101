			<h1>Hello World!!!! :3</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Open the file and add Hello World to the title line.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The initial problems we encountered were trying to distinguish which line was appropriate fot the "Hello World!" placement.
						<br> We solved this by trial and error and seeing what line affects what on the site.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think we put a good amount of work to complete this assignment. We did extra research for stylistic choices
						<br> I learned how to line break and Athena learned how to change the colors :]
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We figured out where Hello World goes and then used that knowledge to answer these questions!</p>
